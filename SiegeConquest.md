# SiegeConquest
A SiegeWar add-on for originally made for earthcraft.me, with optional, old-school Conquering/Annexing.

**SiegeConquest adds a choice to the standard SiegeWar invasion system.**

Upon placement of the Invasion banner, the player is prompted to select either Annexation or Occupation. Occupation is the normal SiegeWar route while Annexation is a new path, closer to original SiegeWar: the town becomes part of the winning nation, (and if the town is a capital of a nation, so do the rest of the nation's towns.)

Upon annexation, the town(s) become(s) Conquered via the normal Towny mechanic, for a configurable amount of days.

Annexed towns cannot:
- delete themselves (optional,)
- set a new mayor (optional,)
- have their mayor leave the town (optional,)
- go into ruin.
- leave their nation.

Annexed towns:
- have their ability to unclaim plots rate-limited (optional.)

When a non-annexed town leaves their nation they:
- lose their peaceful status if they have one (optional,)
- lose their siege immunity, if they have any (optional.)

There are config options to prevent deleting a town or nation under siege, or toggling neutral on a town which is sieged.

## Multi-language
The same multi-language that exists in Towny, SiegeWar and other TownyAdvanced plugins is also available in SiegeConquest.
